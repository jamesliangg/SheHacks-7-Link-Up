# SheHacks-7-Link-Up
## Inspiration
Last minute cancellations ruin group meet ups. Even after agreeing on a date that everyone is free, someone still ends up cancelling. We wanted to find a way to reliably confirm availability and plan for an event.

## What it does
Our program takes in your group's personal calendars and shows you all the unavailable time slots. The user can then pick a time and date for their event. The plan will be downloaded into a calendar file that can be added to everyone's calendar.

## How we built it
We built it with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. JavaScript is used for going through the calendar files and creating the downloadable calendar file. HTML and CSS are used to build and style the website in a user friendly way.

## Challenges we ran into
- Keeping everyone's projects on the latest commit

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- The website is styled nicely!
- All the functions work perfectly!

## What we learned
- Using HTML with CSS

## What's next for LinkUp
- Page for users to upload their calendar and strip out any personal information before passing on the file
- Central database with user authentication so calendars can be uploaded directly
